# CR-10 Firmware
Here I'll keep my relevant project files for creating a custom firmware for my CR-10 3d Printer.


## Resources I used for this project:


### SKR Mini Installation: 

[Big Tree Tech SKR Mini E3 V3.0 and 3.5‚Äù touch screen upgrade on Ender-3 Pro, fixing BLtouch issue Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtwWnz2-5VQ) By Aurora Tech was very useful in the step-by-step board swapping. 

I also used a diagram on [Biqu.equpiment's store page](https://biqu.equipment/collections/control-board/products/bigtreetech-skr-mini-e3-v2-0-32-bit-control-board-integrated-tmc2209-uart-for-ender-4?variant=31995474640994) to help identify ports as well.


### Firmware Installation:

[Make 'n' Print's SKR MINI E3 V2 Setup Guide](https://www.makenprint.uk/3d-printing/3d-printing-guides/skr-mini-e3-v2-setup-guide/#tft) was critical in giving me the confidence to customize the firmware I needed to run this printer.

[@Mechitworks](https://github.com/Mechitworks/3dPrinting) configuration was incredibly useful here as well. I believe their setup was similar so I used it to look for weirdness in my configurations.


## TODO:

* Create a github action to publish the firmware automatically based on the main branch.
